A basic website utilizing event listeners.

# How it works
**Tech Used**: HTML, CSS, and Javascript

In the HTML, there are two divs. One has some text content and spans, and the other has buttons in it. I added some basic CSS styling to align with the assignment description. In the JavaScript, I mostly just followed the assignment's description. I did make some personal design changes that I thought was nice. For example, I used querySelector instead of getElementById, as this was how I learned to select elements. I also used textContent and addEventListener for similar reasons. I made the name of the function to alert the calculated age "computeAge" to follow the verbNoun naming scheme of the other functions, just for personal consistency.

The description of the assignment called for console.log statements showing where the javascript file starts and ends, and also for the functions beginning and ends.

# Lessons learned
I have been studying javascript and events on my own recently, so this assignment was pretty good practice for modifying the DOM with Javascript.
